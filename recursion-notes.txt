Write a function that console logs every number from 'n' to 0

function printNumber(n, decrement = 1) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return;
  }

  console.log(n);
  printNumber(n - decrement);
}

printNumber(10);

Recursion Tips
- Figure out the bare minimum pieces of info to represent the problem
-- Don't pass any info into the function that it doesn't need to 'do the work'
- Give reasonable defaults to the bare minimum info
- Check the base case.
-- Is there any work left to do? If not, return
-- Base case: the case where the recursion is done and doesn't need to do more work
- After adding the logic, call the function again
-- Make sure to change the arguments to the recursively called function
