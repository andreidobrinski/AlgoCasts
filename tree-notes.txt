Tree Traversal

Breadth-First Traversal
- horizontally, left to right
- traversing all siblings and elements on the same level before going to children

Depth-First Traversal
- vertically, trying to get to the bottom of the tree as fast as possible
- traversing any and all children of a node, before the siblings
