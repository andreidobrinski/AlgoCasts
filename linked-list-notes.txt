Linked List

Ordered collection of data
- collection of nodes containing some data, and a reference to the next node
- aka chain (of nodes)
- a connection to separate pieces of data (objects)
- order of linked list doesn't change, unless you specify that it does
- HEAD node = first node
- TAIL node = last node

Convention
- the data property is called "data"
- the reference to the next node is called "next"
